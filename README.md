## Clone this repository

Run the following in the command line in the directory where you would like this repo to be stored.

git clone --branch assignment1 https://bitbucket.org/shortestpathlab/fit3080.git

You can also use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to clone the repo without using the command line. We recommend you use the command line as it is good practice and less work overall. 
If you decide to use SourceTree then be aware that the teaching doesn't have experience with it and may not be able to help you if you get stuck. There should be plenty of resources to help you online though.

The following example shows how you can test your implementation (modify the -l
